    <h1>Why Your Dog is Actually a World-Class Spy.</h1>
    <hr />
    <p class="eg1">
      Okay, hold on to your seat, because Pepper is NOT just a dog—she’s a spy.
      This four-year-old German Shepherd has been undercover since day one.
      Like, I swear she knows when I'm planning to leave the house because she
      somehow gets her "spy mode" activated the second I pick up my keys. She’ll
      stare at me with this intense, secret-agent gaze, like she’s memorizing my
      every move for the CIA’s next mission. Forget treats—she’s probably
      tracking my every bite to report back to her Boss.
    </p>

    <p class="eg2">
      And don’t even get me started on the Zomato guy. The second rings the
      bell, Pepper’s already in full stealth mode—low to the ground, watching
      his every step like he’s some kind of villain. I’m pretty sure she’s got a
      whole database of suspicious characters, and the Zomato guy is at the top.
      She’s out here gathering intel, and I’m just waiting for her to send me a
      “classified” file titled, How to Catch the Zomato Guy in 5 Easy Steps.
